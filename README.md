# 1ºYear of projects
### Skills I Learned & Improved:
      - Team management
      - Software Development 
      - Python
      - Terrain-Based-Navegation
      - Inertial Navegation
      - PID controler 
      - MavLink Communication
      - Telemetry 
      - ROV Maintenance

### The first projects done with the ROV were:
      - Retriving important sensor telemetry
      - Staying at the same depth (PID controler)
      - Autonomous Inertial Navegation software


## Description & Overview of the projects
The first advance was configuring the ROV and resolving every communication problem the ROV had and developing autonomous software.
